# Dank-memer-coin-leecher
(I really recomend using Coinbombleechsafe.py as Coinbombleechperfect.py is just overkill)

You want them sweet sweet meme coins? well you came to the right place


important note, it should now reply with whatever is highligted in the message sent by dank memer and not "i want money" since they seem to change it every once in a while


For this script to be effective, you need to go to a place with a lot of coin bombs (like this server for exemple: https://discord.gg/Wejhbd4 )


There is multiple version of this script, with multiple level of safeties:



**Coinbombleech.py** (Not safe at all)

The original script, it reply "i want money" whenever someone says "pls use coin", "pls use bomb" or "pls use coinbomb"

It reply instantly so it's obvious you're botting, i got muted in the Dank memer server because i used it



**Coinbombleechdelay.py** (safer, but still notisable)

The v2, it reply "i want money" whenever someone says "pls use coin", "pls use bomb" or "pls use coinbomb"

It reply with a random delay from 500ms to 3000ms (easilly changeable in the script)



**Coinbombleechsafe.py** (should be safe)

The v3, it reply "i want money" whenever the bot says someone used a coinbomb, so people can't just say pls use coin a lot to prove you're botting

It reply with a random delay from 750ms to 3000ms (easilly changeable in the script)



**Coinbombleechperfect.py** (if you get spotted idk what to tell you it's safe af)

The v4, it have a 1/3 chance of replying "i want money" whenever the bot says someone used a coinbomb, so people can't just say pls use coin a lot to prove you're botting and you won't even reply to all of them so you seem human

It reply with a random delay from 1000ms to 5000ms (easilly changeable in the script)
